        Calatrava’s plan includes the global terminal and a business complex
        with formal gardens that would remake the present site of parking
        facilities next to the terminals. The terminal is formed with a pointed
        form featuring a white roof overhang. The terminal’s interior features
        Calatrava's white-on-white uniform surfaces with plenty of natural
        light.

        The terminal building was designed by British architects Zaha Hadid
        Architects and French planners ADPI, and executed by the Beijing
        Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD). It consists of a central hub
        with six curved spokes.[15] Hong Kong design studio Lead 8 was appointed

      <p>
        Kuwait International Airport is planned to significantly increase
        capacity and establish a new regional air hub in the Gulf - these
        strategic aims will be matched by a state-of-the-art terminal building,
        which will provide the highest levels of comfort for passengers and will
        set a new environmental benchmark for airport buildings. Its design is
        rooted in a sense of place, responsive to the climate of one of the
        hottest inhabited environments on earth and inspired by local forms and
        materials.
